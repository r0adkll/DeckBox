# kotlin-inject-merge (ðŸš§ work-in-progress ðŸš§)

This module is a KSP compiler that acts like [anvil](https://github.com/square/anvil) for [kotlin-inject](https://github.com/evant/kotlin-inject) providing a way for developers to contribute interfaces/bindings/etc to the kotlin-inject graph from their own modules without having to wire anything upstream.

This will eventually be moved to its own repository once I've finished baking its implementation in this project.
